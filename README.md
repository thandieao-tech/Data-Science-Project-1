In CS 2064 we were given a project where we had to answer three data science questions of our choice.
We were to use three different methods (APIs, Direct download, Webscraping), and then had to make a graph for some of the aquired data.
Attached are school_scores.py and school_scores.txt, both files not crated by me, but are from a free website and are used in the project.
